# react-github-corners
a react wrapper for the awesome "github-corners" ribbon by tholman https://github.com/tholman/github-corners

I will not upload the package npm due to several reasons:

1. it seems like it has been done before me: https://github.com/mshenfield/react-github-corners
2. it was meant to be a practice to "get-started" with rollup :)

if anyone wants this to become a proper package, do tell and I'll upload it :)
